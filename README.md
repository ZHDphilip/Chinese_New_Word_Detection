# Chinese_New_Word_Detection
1: This is an optimized version of @zhanzeCheng's Chinese_segment_augment Project. 
   Used Dict instead of List so that we can search and insert nodes into the TrieTree
   in Linear Time (i.e. O(1)), significantly boosting the program's efficiency.
   
2: I have not learned about Parallel Programming in Python yet, so reading and cutting txt may
   still cost a while. (1.5-million-line txt file process in approximately 5 min)
